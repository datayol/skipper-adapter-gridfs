GridFS adapter for receiving [upstreams](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper#what-are-upstreams). Particularly useful for handling streaming multipart file uploads from the [Skipper](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper) body parser.


## Installation

```
$ npm install skipper-adapter-gridfs --save
```

Also make sure you have skipper itself [installed as your body parser](http://beta.sailsjs.org/#/documentation/concepts/Middleware?q=adding-or-overriding-http-middleware).  This is the default configuration in [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) as of v0.10.
